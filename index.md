# About me

Hi, I'm Andrea Herrera, an Economic Geography PhD candidate specializing in Urban Economics. I am studying the effects of urban planning and transport infrastructure on housing outcomes and the spatial distribution of economic activity and people using Quantitative Spatial Models. I am interested in learning about the spatial determinants of intergenerational mobility, spatial inequalities, segregation, and gender inequalities.

## Working papers
#### The Causal Effects of Height Regulations on Urban Development: Evidence from Londonâ€™s Protected Vistas <span style="color:red;">[Working Paper - Coming soon!]</span>

This paper examines the causal effects of height restrictions using London's Protected Views policy as a natural experiment. Unlike typical zoning laws, these restrictions are exogenously determined by historical sightlines rather than economic or political factors, overcoming boundary endogeneity concerns. Using a border discontinuity design, I find that height limits reduce built height at corridor boundaries, though property prices show no apparent discontinuity. This study advances urban regulation and zoning literature by providing causal estimates and new insights into the unintended consequences of height restrictions in high-demand cities. As a next step, I will develop a quantitative spatial model to assess the general equilibrium effects of these restrictions on prices and welfare. 


#### The Effects of Transport Infrastructure on Housing Supply: The Role of Land-Use Regulation. Co-authored with Kenzo Asahi and Hugo Silva. <a href="/assets/pdf/Asahi, Herrera, Silva (2024).pdf" class="custom-link">[Working Paper]</a>.

We study the impact of new transportation infrastructure on housing supply using historical and micro data from Santiago and exploiting instrumental variables. We find that subway and highway expansions increase residential floor space substantially, but when we account for land-use regulation, we see two contrasting dynamics in the city. In the wealthiest quintile, the effect is negligible for more than 95% of the blocks due to their initial stringent regulation. However, in blocks in the first four quintiles of wealth, the impact on housing supply is substantial and homogeneous concerning the initial regulation. We provide evidence that the transport infrastructure triggers regulation to become more permissive everywhere but in the wealthiest neighborhoods. We quantify how land-use regulation limits housing supply, thus restraining welfare gains from transport infrastructure improvements.
