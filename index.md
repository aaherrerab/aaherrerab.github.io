# About me

Hi, I'm Andrea Herrera, an Economic Geography PhD student specializing in Urban Economics. I have a background in economics and am studying the effects of transport and urban planning on the housing market and spatial distribution of economic activity and people. I am interested in learning about the spatial determinants of intergenerational mobility, spatial inequalities, segregation, and gender inequalities.
